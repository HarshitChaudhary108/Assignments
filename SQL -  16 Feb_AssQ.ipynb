    "#### A database is a collection of structured information or data typically stored in a electronically operated system. A databse is usually controlled by the database management system (DBMS).\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL and NoSQL Databases\n",
    "#### structured query language(SQL) is a programming language for both technical and non technical minded users to manipulate, manage and change data in a relational database. SQL works best with the structured data, such as name and class, which have relations between different entities. In SQL data is generally stored in tabular form\n",
    "\n",
    "#### NoSQL Database doesn't mean it doesn't use SQL, it actually means that it doesn't use SQL only. where SQL works best with structured data, here NoSQL works with Structured, semi-structured and non structured data as well. it stores data in a manner other than SQL. NoSQL uses non-tabular data for example : image, audio, video and etc"
